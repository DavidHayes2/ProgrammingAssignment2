makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  ## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" 
  ## object that can cache its inverse.
}


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of
  ##  the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
  ## If the inverse has already been calculated
  ## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should return
  ## the inverse from the cache (i..e . the inverse of 'x')
}
