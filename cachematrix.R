cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned
  ## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
  ## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should return
  ## the inverse from the cache (i..e . the inverse of 'x')
